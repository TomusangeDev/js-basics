# JavaScript Basics

This repository contains my JavaScript learning journey.  
I’m using it to practice core JavaScript concepts with small examples and mini projects as I grow.

## What I'm Learning
- Variables
- Data types
- Operators
- Conditions
- Loops
- Functions
- Basic DOM manipulation
- Events

## Project Structure
Each topic has its own folder, for example:

<b>_Variables(folder📂)_<b/>

        |———variables.html
        
        |———variables.js
