# JavaScript Basics 🟨

This repository contains my JavaScript learning journey.  
I’m using it to practice core JavaScript concepts with small examples and mini projects as I grow.

## 📌 What I'm Learning
- Variables
- Data types
- Operators
- Conditions
- Loops
- Functions
- Basic DOM manipulation
- Events

## 📂 Project Structure
Each topic has its own folder, for example:
_Variables(folder📂)
     |———variables.html
     |———variables.js_
